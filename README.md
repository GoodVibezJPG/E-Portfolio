Made with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, for my final Project for Camosun's ICS 118 - Web Foundamentals.

A page that I can build onto in the future as further my skills, and can present to others about what I can accomplish with my Web Dev skills.
Key things about the webpage is the alternate Winter ❄️ theming, Web3Forms Mail Form API, and SVGs, and their animations.
